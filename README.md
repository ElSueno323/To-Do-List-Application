# Task Manager Application

This project is a **Task Manager** application that allows users to manage tasks. Users can create, view, update, and delete tasks, and track their status (pending or complete). The application is split into two parts:

1. **Frontend**: Built with **Vue.js** for an interactive user interface.
2. **Backend**: Built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **PostgreSQL** for handling task data and API interactions.
