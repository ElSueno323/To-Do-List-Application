# Task Manager - Frontend

This is the frontend for a Task Manager application built with **Vue.js**. The application allows users to manage their tasks by performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Features

- **Task List**: Displays all tasks retrieved from the backend.
- **Task Creation**: Allows users to create new tasks.
- **Task Deletion**: Users can delete tasks from the list.
- **Mark as Complete**: Users can mark tasks as completed, changing their status from "pending" to "complete".
- **Responsive Design**: The interface is designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **API Integration**: The frontend communicates with a backend API to perform all CRUD operations.
